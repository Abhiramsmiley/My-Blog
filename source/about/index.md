## Abhiram S S

### Operating Domain

I work in **product security**, focusing on **red teaming and adversarial testing** of modern applications and platforms.

My work begins where design assumptions end—testing systems under conditions of abuse, misuse, and intentional failure. I evaluate how products behave when trust boundaries are crossed and controls are stressed beyond their intended purpose.

---

### Adversarial Perspective

Security that exists only on paper is not security.

I analyze products from the attacker’s point of view, mapping how authentication, authorization, identity, and cloud components can be combined into viable attack paths. The objective is not to find isolated bugs, but to understand **how systems fail as a whole**.

---

### Method

I focus on:
- Breaking implicit trust in application logic  
- Abusing identity and access control flows  
- Chaining low-risk issues into high-impact outcomes  
- Validating whether defenses hold under real pressure  

Controls are not trusted until they resist intent.

### Purpose of This Site

This site documents **real attack paths, failure patterns, and security lessons** derived from hands-on testing.  
It is not a tutorial blog, and it is not theoretical research—it is a record of what breaks and why.
